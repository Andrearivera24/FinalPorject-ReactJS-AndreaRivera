# Spanish By Hispanics 
## Â¡Learn Spanish with native teachers!
 



This is the second pre-delivery of the final project for React Js, it consists of an application with basic navigability, in which I used: 

- Routes.
- Links.
- Hooks like, useParams, useState, useEffect
- Components.
- Chakra, React-router-dom.

The purpose of the project is to build a platform where users who wish to learn Spanish as a second language, can access personalized classes with native teachers. To do so, they will find a tab called " Professors" where they will find all the information about each one of them and they will also be able to filter by nationality.
