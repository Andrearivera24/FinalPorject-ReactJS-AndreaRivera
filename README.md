# Spanish By Hispanics 
## Learn Spanish with native teachers!

Welcome to my final project for React JS course.
 
The purpose of the project is to build a platform where users who wish to learn Spanish as a second language, can access and purchase personalized classes with native teachers. To do so, they will find a tab called "Professors" where they will find all the information about each one of them (they will also be able to filter by nationality). 

Once the user selects the number of classes desired with each teacher, they will confirm their purchase, verifying the details and entering their personal information. Finally, they will receive a tracking code for their purchase. 


## Basic navigability in which I used:
- JSX and transpiling
- Components
- Promises, asynchrony and MAP
- Routing and navigation
- Events
- Context
- Firebase
- Different rendering techniques
- CSS
- Chakra, React-router-dom

### Tecnologies
- Webpack VITE
- React Library
- React-router-dom
- Chakra UI 
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
### Set UP 
#### 1. In "Nodejs. command prompt" terminal
```
$ npm init vite@latest

$ npm install 
$ code . 
```
#### 2. Now in "VScode" terminal:
